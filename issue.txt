Hello Github !

When I was working on notebooks on github, I found a strange interaction on the github file previewer.

On the github file previewer of notebooks (file.ipynb), in a markdown cell, when I click on an image that should redirect the user, it doesn't work, it just shows "this content is blocked. contact the site owner...", except if I "open it on a new tab". In this case, my page will be well opened in the new tab.
So I tried to set a 'target="_blank"' on my redirection but that doesn't do anything.

That's not all !
When I try to click on a side of the image, I will be well redirected on the good page.
Strangely, when I use a text as redirection, it works well.

The only thing I found to fix it, is to set the 'target="_parent"'

Last thing that I have to say is that, when you have the same type of redirection on a markdown file, it works well. For example, in a Readme.md, it will be no problem.

I did a test repo to compare the differents situations: https://github.com/QuentinKlebaur/Notebook_preview_issue

Thanks for reading and took attention to this message !
Have a nice day !
